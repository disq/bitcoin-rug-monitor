Mining Rug (The name's not a typo. Well, it was at some point, but this one's intentional)

Requirements:

1. php-cli
2. rrdtool
3. aticonfig (won't work on windows, sorry)

No webserver required. But ideally you want to access the graphs/ dir from the web somehow :)

Setup:

1. Run gen-config.php to generate a config.json
2. Optionally edit config.json to rename devices and your rug name (You can do this later)
3. To get the hashrate from Phoenix Miner, apply the supplied diff with "patch -p1 < logtotext.diff" in the Phoenix dir (There are different patches for 1.47 and 1.48) and run each of your miners with "-t /tmp/<unique-name>" parameter.
Other miners are not supported out of the box. But you can add support for them (see getStatus() in lib/query.php)
You could set status_type to "hashrate" and point status_file to a file with the current hashrate in it, though. Last modified time is read from the filesystem.
It won't accept data in files modified more than 3 seconds ago.

4. Edit config.json to set status_file to path to the file in step 3

5. Run getstatus.php and see if it spits out current information. If it doesn't, re-edit the config or check if aticonfig works in the system.

6. Run gen-rrd.php to create the rrd files in rrd/

7. Run update.php this time, and look for error messages.

8. Setup cron to execute update.php each minute. Example:

$ crontab -e
add "* * * * * ~/rug-monitor/update.php >/tmp/monitor-update.out 2>&1" to end of the file, add a newline as well

9. Run gen-graph.php each time you want to generate graphs in graphs/

10. You can run "gen-graph.php all" to generate weekly and monthly graphs as well as separate graphs for each day in the last week.

11. If you want multi rig graphs, see the copy-data.sh script in other-rigs/. You basically need to fetch rrd files and the config.json from each of your rugs.


Good luck!
